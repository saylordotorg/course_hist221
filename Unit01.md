**Unit 1: The Atlantic World in the Late 15th Century** <span
id="1"></span> 
*The late 15<sup>th</sup> century was a time of great political,
military, and economic activity across the Iberian Peninsula, the
geographical region that now encompasses the modern-day nations of Spain
and Portugal.*  *  The marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of
Castile in 1479 united the two major Spanish kingdoms of the peninsula
and allowed both states to pool their resources in order to conquer the
remaining Muslim strongholds in southern Spain in the early 1490s.  In
the kingdom of Portugal, Prince Henry the Navigator developed
sophisticated navigation equipment that enabled Portuguese mariners to
explore coastal Africa and establish a trade route across the Indian
Ocean to the East Indies in the later 15<sup>th</sup> century.  In 1492,
Ferdinand and Isabella funded the Christopher Columbus’ expedition to
find a western trade route to the East Indies that would cross the
Atlantic Ocean.  Columbus’ expedition led to the first European contact
with the native peoples of the Western Hemisphere and established the
kingdom of Spain’s claim to all the land in this vast, unexplored
territory.  In this unit, we will evaluate the political, economic, and
social contexts of Iberian exploration in the Atlantic Ocean in the late
15<sup>th</sup> century and examine the civilizations that Spanish and
Portuguese explorers encountered in Africa and the Americas. *
