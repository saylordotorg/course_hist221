**Unit 8: The End of an Empire** <span id="8"></span> 
*By the second decade of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, Spain had lost
political control of its vast colonial empire in the Americas.  Only the
Caribbean islands of Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish
possession.  In 1821, Brazil’s monarch declared independence from the
Portuguese crown and Portugal lost control of its only major American
colony.  Meanwhile, the independence movements across Central and South
America resulted in the creation of numerous independent nations.  While
many of these nations retained social and economic ties to Spain, they
exercised their new independence by forming regional political alliances
with other former Spanish colonies.  In this final unit, we will examine
how independence movements reshaped Central and South America and led to
new economic ties with the United States and England.  We will also look
at how these new connections played a profound role in shaping the
development of these young nations in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early
20<sup>th</sup> centuries.*
