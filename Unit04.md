**Unit 4: Colonial Economy and Trade Networks** <span id="4"></span> 
*The promise of gold and silver treasures lured early Spanish explorers
and settlers to the Americas, but few colonists found easy riches. 
Instead, many Spanish settlers turned to mining and agriculture
production as a source of revenue.  Native Americans, and later African
slaves, provided much of the labor for the gold and silver mines of
South America and the sugar plantations of the Caribbean.  The Spanish
crown tightly regulated colonial trade and forced Spanish colonists to
only conduct business with Spanish merchants in Spain.  These colonial
regulations frustrated many colonists and encouraged smuggling and
illicit trade partnerships with English and Dutch merchants.  Spain
attempted to defend her colonies and prevent trade with other European
nations, but in many ways this was a losing battle.  In this unit, we
will look at the evolution of the Spanish colonial economy and examine
how systems of production and trade altered the structure of colonial
society.  We will also learn how Spanish mercantile trade practices
hindered colonial development and led to conflicts with other European
powers.      *
