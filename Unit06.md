**Unit 6: Trans-Atlantic Empires** <span id="6"></span> 
*Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the Americas formed part of a
broader global empire administered by the Spanish and Portuguese
states.  Consequently, wars and political conflicts in Europe often had
a significant impact on political and economic life in the colonies. 
During the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries, the Hapsburg
monarchy controlled Spain and expanded its military and political
influence throughout much of western and central Europe.  Gold and
silver production in the colonies funded Spanish military victories and
provided ample financial resources for the Spanish state.  By the end of
the 17<sup>th</sup> century, though, a series of weak Hapsburg rulers
and poor management of the royal treasury had brought Spain to the brink
of political collapse.  The War of Spanish Succession ended Hapsburg
control of Spain and brought the French Bourbon family to the Spanish
throne.  Bourbon rulers instituted a number of major political and
economic reforms in the colonies in an attempt to restore colonial
stability and profitability.  Despite these efforts, Spanish colonies
faced increasing military threats from English and Dutch settlements in
the Americas over the course of the 18<sup>th</sup> century.  In this
unit, we will examine how the transition from Hapsburg to Bourbon rule
in Spain altered political, economic, and social life in Spain’s
colonies.  We will also look at the political relationship between Spain
and Portugal and discuss how this relationship shaped colonization and
settlement patterns in Brazil.  Finally, we will discuss how Spanish and
Portuguese colonies fit into the broader Atlantic World economy at the
end of the 18<sup>th</sup> century.     *
