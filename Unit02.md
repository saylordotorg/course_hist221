**Unit 2: Conquest of the Americas** <span id="2"></span> 
*Spanish explorers established the first permanent settlements in the
Americas on the Caribbean island of Hispanola in the early 1500s.  Over
the next half-century, Spanish conquistadors, or conquerors, used these
early settlements as jumping off points for expeditions along the coasts
of North, Central, and South America.  In 1519, Spanish explorer Hernán
Cortés landed on the east coast of modern-day Mexico with a small
contingent of about 600 soldiers and sailors and began a two-year
military campaign against the mighty Aztec Empire.  In 1521, Cortés’
Spanish forces, with the aid of a large number of Indian warriors,
overthrew Aztec Emperor Moctezuma and took control of the Aztec capital
of Tenochtitlan.  The Spanish established Mexico City on the ruins of
Tenochtitlan.  This new city became the heart of their growing colonial
empire in the Americas.  In this unit, we will learn how Spanish
conquistadors conquered native peoples across the Americas over the
course of the 16<sup>th</sup> century and expanded Spanish domination of
the Western Hemisphere.  We will also look at how Spanish contact with
American natives led to technological and agricultural exchanges as well
as the spread of new diseases among both groups.  The so-called
“Columbian Exchange” led to unexpected consequences for each side and
profoundly altered life in Europe and the Americas during the 1500s.*
