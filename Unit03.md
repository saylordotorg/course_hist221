**Unit 3: Colonization and Settlement** <span id="3"></span> 
*As conquistadors gradually established Spanish military control over
the Americas in the 16<sup>th</sup> and early 17<sup>th</sup> centuries,
the Spanish government struggled to impose civil order on its growing
overseas empire.  Royal governors were appointed to administer the major
settlements in Central and South America.  These officials attempted to
replicate traditional Spanish civil and religious institutions in the
New World.  The Catholic Church also played a major role in the
colonization and settlement of Spanish America.  Church officials in the
Americas challenged the mistreatment and virtual enslavement that native
peoples suffered at the hands of the conquistadors and other powerful
settlers using the royal system of labor to force Indians to work on
their plantations without compensation.  Disease and mistreatment
significantly reduced native populations in many parts of Central and
South American during the 16<sup>th</sup> century and some settlers
began employing African slave labor to replace Indians.  The presence of
Europeans, Indians, and Africans in the Spanish colonies gradually led
to the emergence of a diverse, mixed-race society in many parts of the
Spanish Empire by the 17<sup>th</sup> century.  In this unit, we will
examine efforts by Spanish colonial administrators and Catholic Church
officials to establish political, economic, social, and religious order
in Spain’s American colonies.  We will also learn about the new creole
society that began to emerge across the Spanish Empire, discussing the
impact that it had on Spain’s efforts to administer its expanding
colonies.    *

     Instructions: Please read the entirety of the text to get an
    understanding of a pioneering set of laws that intended the gradual
    abolition of the *encomienda* system.  This royal decree, issued in
    response to the Catholic Church’s complaints about the mistreatment
    of Indians in the Spanish Colonies, presents clear rules about how
    Indians are to be treated by colonial landowners.  Landowners are
    forbidden from treating Indians as slaves and holding them against
    their will.  The decree warns landowners that they will have their
    Indian labor force confiscated if they do not treat them justly.  
    Some landowners refused to recognize the decree and prevented it
    from being implemented in parts of Spanish America.  The
    *encomienda* was replaced by other forms of labor systems after
    mid-century.
