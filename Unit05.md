**Unit 5: Colonial Society** <span id="5"></span> 
*Caste and social standing structured Spanish colonial society in the
Americas.  Clear social distinctions existed between European settlers,
native-born colonists, people of mixed ancestry, and Indian and African
natives.  People of mixed ancestry and Criollos (people of Spanish
ancestry born in the colonies) had fewer political and legal rights than
Peninsulares (individuals that had been born in Spain and immigrated to
the colonies).  Peninsulares dominated colonial society and held
important civil and religious positions.  This strict caste system bred
resentment among Criollos and native people. *  
  
 *Family connections and gender also played an important role in
structuring colonial society.  In Spain, women had relatively little
social power, but in the colonies, they often played a far greater role
in their communities, as they managed homes and local businesses while
their husbands were away fighting or overseeing distant business.  In
this unit, we will examine the political, economic, and social structure
of Spanish colonial society and look at the important caste distinctions
between different social groups.  We will also discuss the role of
families in colonial society and look at how women expanded their social
and economic presence in daily life over the course of the
16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries.      *
