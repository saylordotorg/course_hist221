This course will introduce you to the history of Latin and South America
from the year in which European explorers first discovered and began to
colonize the region to the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, when many
Latin and South American colonies declared their independence from
European rule.  You will learn about the major political, economic, and
social changes that took place throughout Latin and South America during
this 400-year period.  The course will be structured chronologically. 
Each unit will include representative primary-source documents that
illustrate important overarching political, economic, and social themes,
such as the conquest of native peoples by European explorers, colonial
settlement patterns and trade networks, social and cultural exchanges
between native peoples and Europeans, and the emergence of independence
movements across Latin and South America at the end of the
18<sup>th</sup> century.  By the end of the course, you will understand
how the interaction between native peoples and European settlers created
diverse and complex colonial societies throughout Latin and South
America, and why the colonies of the region eventually declared their
independence from European political control.
