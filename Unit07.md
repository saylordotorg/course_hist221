**Unit 7: Crisis and Revolution** <span id="7"></span> 
*The French Revolution and the resulting European political and military
crisis of the 1790s and 1800s had a profound impact on Spanish and
Portuguese colonies in the Americas.  Under military pressure from
Napoleon, Spain secretly transferred control of its vast Louisiana
Territory to France in 1800.  Napoleon then sold the territory to the
United States three years later.  In 1808, Napoleon invaded Spain and
Portugal and declared his brother Joseph the new king.  The Portuguese
court fled to Brazil and declared the colony to be the new capitol of
the Portuguese Empire.  The sudden fall of Spain created a power vacuum
in the Spanish colonies and led many local officials to assume control
over colonial governments.  In 1808, a poorly planned attempt by the
British to seize military control of the Spanish colonies along the Rio
de la Plata, the waterway that separates modern-day Argentina and
Uruguay, sparked a powerful resistance movement in the region that
inspired a number of revolutionaries to organize independence movements
across Central and South America.  Over the next few years, these
revolutionaries challenged Spanish military forces and fought for
self-rule in the Spanish colonies.  In this unit, we will examine how
the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars ended Spanish control over
its colonial possessions and discuss how the conflict contributed to the
growth of colonial independence movements throughout the Americas. *

     The French Revolution began in May 1789 with the meeting of the
    Estates-General—a general assembly representing the three French
    estates of the realm: the nobility, the church, and the common
    people.  Summoned by King Louis XVI to propose solutions to his
    government’s financial problems, the Estates-General sat for several
    weeks in May and June 1789 but came to an impasse as the three
    estates clashed over their respective powers.   It was brought to an
    end when many members of the Third Estate formed themselves into a
    National Assembly, signaling the outbreak of the Revolution.   On
    July 14 of that same year, the Bastille—amedieval fortress and
    prison which represented royal authority in the center of Paris—was
    stormed by a mob that demanded the arms and ammunition stored
    there.  This web media should take approximately 15 minutes to

    Louis XV and his wife tried to escape Paris in 1791, the French
    revolutionary wars began soon thereafter; however, fighting soon
    went badly and prices rose sky-high.  In August 1792, a mob
    assaulted the Royal Palace in Paris and arrested the King.  In
    September, the Assembly abolished the monarchy and declared a
    republic.  This web media should take approximately 15 minutes to

     The French invasion of Russia in 1812 was a turning point in the
    Napoleonic Wars.  It reduced the French invasion forces to a tiny
    fraction of their initial strength and triggered a major shift in
    European politics as it dramatically weakened French hegemony in
    Europe. As a result, the reputation of Napoleon as an undefeated
    military genius was severely shaken.  This web media should take
